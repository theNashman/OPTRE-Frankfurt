Arma 3 Operation Trebuchet mission

This is a quick mission for the Operation Trebuchet mod for Arma 3.
It focuses on stealth and speed.

Mode: Singleplayer (MP support on the way)
Mission Length: 30 - 45 minutes.

Required Addons:  

    1. CBA
    2. Operation Trebuchet
Reccomended:

    1. ACE3
    2. OPTRE ACE3 Compat Patch

Your objectives are three:

    1. Destroy a URF ammo cache
    2. Collect vital intel on the location of one of their leaders.
    3. Extradite a VIP and Extract safely.

Some notable features:

    1. Active Camo script to help you sneak past enemies (doesn't last forever and needs to recharge)
    2. TBD

I intend to make this mission part of a larger campaign in the future if it proves successful and enjoyable.

I'm thinking something along the lines of Republic Commando, with unique teammates that possess different skills,
personalities and trais to help you with your mission.

It's a big project and I understand the limitations of Arma 3's engine so that would be on hold till I've figured this out.
